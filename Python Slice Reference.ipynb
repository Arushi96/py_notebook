    "# Python Slice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This excerpt is taken from:\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/introduction.html\n",
    "\n",
    "another **good resource** found, which explains slice in detail is:\n",
    "https://www.dotnetperls.com/slice-python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain substring:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)\n",
    "'Py'\n",
    ">>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)\n",
    "'tho'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> word[:2] + word[2:]\n",
    "'Python'\n",
    ">>> word[:4] + word[4:]\n",
    "'Python'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)\n",
    "'Py'\n",
    ">>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end\n",
    "'on'\n",
    ">>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end\n",
    "'on'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " | P | y | t | h | o | n |\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " 0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n",
    "-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0...6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice from i to j consists of all characters between the edges labeled i and j, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the difference of the indices, if both are within bounds. For example, the length of word[1:3] is 2.\n",
    "Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "IndexError: string index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    "However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> word[4:42]\n",
    "'on'\n",
    ">>> word[42:]\n",
    "''\n",
    "```"
